This is my little portion of the internet. You can usually find me under the handle `paytonr` or `paytonredemer`.

I work as an embedded software engineer at [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com). I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

I'm all about efficiency in my workflow, and I use tools like neovim and tmux. See more about [my workflow](./blog/workflow).

Outside of software, I enjoy cycling, playing music, and discussing politics. Oh, and I'm also a parent to a rabbit.
